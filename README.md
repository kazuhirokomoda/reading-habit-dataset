# Reading habit Dataset

## Installation

The code was tested on [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) but there should be no additional libraries to run the code beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python (versions 3.\*).

The code has printed out the version for important libraries for future reference.

## Project Motivation

I am personally interested in building and maintaining good habits. I took reading as an example, and chose [Reading habit Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/vipulgote4/reading-habit-dataset) to better understand:

1. What factors about an individual contributed to number of books to read?
2. Which media (printed books, e-books, audiobooks) results in more books to be read?
3. How do the book lovers differentiate themselves from others?
